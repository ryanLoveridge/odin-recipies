    <h2>Instant Pot Goulash </h2>
        <p>Goulash is a traditional paprika-heavy Hungarian stew made out of veal, pork, beef, or lamb, with a variety of vegetables ranging from carrots and onions to celery and peppers. The American version of goulash keeps some of the wholesome flavors, but adds short pasta into the mix, relying on tomatoes to make a tangy and vibrant sauce that coats the pasta. </p>
        <p>Comforting and easy, American goulash is a wonderful one-pot dish that is flavorful and customizable. The recipe can take on any other veggies of your liking—like bell peppers, mushrooms, or celery—and can be topped with cheese for an extra layer of goodness.</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Gather the ingredients. </li>
            <li>Press the "Sauté" function to heat up the Instant Pot. Once the machine reads "Hot" add the ground beef. Cook, stirring until browned. </li>
            <li>Remove the beef from the pot, leaving behind some of the fat. Add the olive oil, onions, bell peppers, salt, and pepper. Sauté until the onions and green peppers have softened but are not browned. </li>
            <li>Add the garlic, basil, oregano, paprika, and tomato paste. Sauté for one more minute, or until the spices become fragrant but have not browned. </li>
            <li>Add the chicken stock or water, soy sauce, and Worcestershire sauce, stirring until all are well combined. Add the crushed tomatoes, macaroni, and the previously reserved ground beef. Make sure the macaroni is totally submerged under the sauce and chicken stock. Cover and cook on high pressure for four minutes.</li>
            <li>Quick release the pressure valve. Once the steam is completely released, carefully remove the lid. Stir, and top with the optional freshly chopped parsley and Parmesan cheese, if using. Serve immediately. </li>
