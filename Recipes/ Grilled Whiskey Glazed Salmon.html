            <li>1/4 cup light soy sauce</li>
            <li>1/4 cup orange juice</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>4 (8-ounce) salmon fillets </li>
        </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

            <li>Mix whiskey, soy sauce, orange juice, oil, and garlic in a medium bowl. </li>
            <li>Place salmon in a shallow dish and pour mixture over the top. Cover with plastic wrap and place in the refrigerator for 3 minutes to 1 hour. </li>
            <li>Preheat the grill for medium-high heat. Once heated, oil the grill grates to create a nonstick surface. Make at least 4 to 5 passes on the grates. </li>

            <li>The salmon is done when it flakes easily, has faded in color, and reaches an internal temperature of at least 145 F. Carefully remove fish from the grill and serve.  </li>
            <li>Plate the fish and serve with your favorite sides.</li>
